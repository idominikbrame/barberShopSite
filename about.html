      <h2>The</h2>
      <h1> Experience</h1>
      <p>
        From the moment they opened the doors to the first DBK Salon in 1988 Fari & Frank focused everything they did on one goal. It meant more than expertly cutting, styling and colouring hair. They needed to make sure clients were comfortable, got the latest precision cuts and styles, and learned how to care for their hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, 30 years later, Fari & Frank’s legacy carries on in every family-owned DBK Salon. And for every customer we serve. It’s a formula that ensures you leave after each visit feeling satisfied with the services and products you received – and feeling more beautiful than ever. That’s really what we’re all about

      <p>
        How can any stylist create a “uniquely personal style” if they 
        don’t learn more about who you are? Every visit starts with a
        professional consultation that tells us where you want to go today.

      <h1> Style</h1>
      <p>
        Yes, every DBK Salon stylist is educated, trained and qualified.
        But that’s just the start. DBK Salon develops its own training programs
         to keep every stylist up-to-date of the ever-changing world of hair 
         styling and care, and how to deliver it just like Frank and Fari did - 
         DBK-style..

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>The</h2>
      <h1> Enlightenment</h1>
      <p>
        Frank and Fari realized that knowledgeable clients are better able to appreciate the DBK Salon experience. They researched, tested and stocked a wide range of top quality products and helped each client understand why and how to use them to maintain their style between visits.
